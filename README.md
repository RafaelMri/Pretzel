This project contains a program to compute link invariants.

A link is a mathematical structure studied in knot theory. Abstractly, it is an
embedding of a disjoint union of S<sup>1</sup>s into R<sup>3</sup>.

The input to this program may be provided in either braid or pretzel notation;
the latter is a generalization of the former. See pretzel.hpp for details.

The computed invariants are:

* Number of components.
* Alexander polynomial.
* Genus of the Seifert surface.
* Seifert matrix.
